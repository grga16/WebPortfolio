            <div class="about-text">Hello my name is Grgur Ivic and I am student at EASV. I was born in Zagreb, Croatia and I moved to denmark to study multimedia design. Since high schools I was interested in that area and that is why I decided to continue my education in that direction. I am a creative and adventurous person. I love to travel a lot and meet new people and see different cultures. Iâ€™m also a big fan of sports and I have been playing football since I was 7 years old. Throughout my education I want to improve my skills in programming but also in designing. My goal is to improve my skills and become a multimedia designer after my studies. I need to start from somewhere so this portfolio is a small beginning of my journey. Here you can find my video CV as well as some of my projects.</div>
